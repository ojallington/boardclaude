Boris values the proven closed-loop improvement that already works and delivers measurable results. For a hackathon submission with time constraints, Boris's position is stronger: the 18.97-point improvement across 4 iterations is concrete evidence of a working system. Structured debate is a compelling post-launch feature that would demonstrate emergent intelligence, but adds architectural complexity to a system that's already succeeding at its core goal. Priority: document the vision for structured debate in BACKLOG.md, but don't implement it pre-launch."
