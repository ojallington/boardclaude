## Debate

Not triggered. No related criteria pairs exceeded divergence threshold of 15.

## Top Strengths

1. npm package published (boardclaude@0.1.0) -- resolves the most critical adoption blocker from iterations 12-13 (Cat, Jason, Ado)
2. 174 tests across 14 files with zero TypeScript errors under strict mode (Boris, Lydia)
3. TSDoc coverage at 93% (42/45 interfaces) with @example snippets, complete community files, production-grade i18n at 100% across 7 locales (Ado, Jason)
4. Universal accessibility: useReducedMotion in all animated components, skip-to-content, aria-live, focus-visible, RTL support (Lydia, Ado, Jason)

## Top Weaknesses

1. CHRONIC (4+ iters): try-invoke.ts fallback path duplicates validation logic (Boris, Lydia)
2. CHRONIC (5+ iters): Board Builder has no YAML preview pane (Cat)
3. CHRONIC (3+ iters): BYOK file budget at 400K chars uses only ~10% of 1M context window (Thariq)
4. Missing Suspense boundaries in ResultsPage and TimelinePage (Lydia)
5. text-gray-400 persists in 41 locations, below WCAG AA contrast (Ado)

## Top 3 Action Items

1. **Fix chronic DRY violation** in try-invoke.ts fallback (Boris, Lydia) -- effort: low
2. **Update website install** to `npx boardclaude install .` (Cat) -- effort: low
3. **Add Suspense boundaries** to ResultsPage/TimelinePage for streaming SSR (Lydia) -- effort: medium
