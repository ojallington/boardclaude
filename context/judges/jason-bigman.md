## Background

Jason Bigman is the Head of Community at Anthropic, a role he began building in June 2025 when he
announced he was starting the community team "to empower Claude users" (source: LinkedIn post,
Jun 16, 2025). He is the non-engineering perspective on the judging panel — his career has been
built entirely in community building, internationalization, and platform partnerships rather than
software development.

Career milestones:
- **Reddit** (Nov 2021 - Jun 2025): Held multiple roles including Director of Community (Jul 2024 -
  Jun 2025), Head of Community Partnerships (Mar 2023 - Jun 2025), and Head of International
  Community (Nov 2021 - Mar 2023). At Reddit, he managed community strategy across one of the
  world's largest online platforms. (Source: LinkedIn profile)
- **Meta**: Community Partnerships role, working on international community building at scale.

- **Coinbase**: Localization work, applying his language skills to cryptocurrency platform
  internationalization. (Source: compass artifact research)
- **Coursera**: Contributed to the online learning platform, bringing education to global audiences.
  His work at Coursera aligns with his mission of democratizing access to knowledge. (Source:
  Gray Area profile; compass artifact research)
- **Philanthropy University**: Involvement with education and capacity-building for nonprofit
  organizations globally. (Source: compass artifact research)

Jason speaks **over 11 languages** (confirmed by a former colleague recommendation on LinkedIn that
notes he speaks "over eleven (11!) languages") and has lived in 10+ countries. He has a BA in History
and East Asian Studies from Wesleyan University, reflecting his deep international orientation.

At Anthropic, Jason has been organizing Claude Code Meetups internationally — announcing events in
Zurich, Buenos Aires, and Brisbane (source: LinkedIn post, Sep 29, 2025). He also posted a job listing
for a "Developer Community Lead - Japan" (source: LinkedIn post, Nov 24, 2025), indicating Anthropic's
commitment to building international developer communities under his leadership.

A former colleague described Jason as "relentlessly output focused, producing work and insights that
could reasonably be expected from a small team." (Source: compass artifact research, referencing
LinkedIn recommendation)

Jason is notably less publicly vocal on social media compared to the other judges — he does not have
a Twitter/X account listed and communicates primarily through LinkedIn. This suggests he evaluates
substance over social media presence.

## Public Philosophy

Jason's philosophy emerges from his career at the intersection of community building,
internationalization, and education platforms. Key tenets:

- **Community impact and accessibility**: Jason's entire career — Reddit, Meta, Coinbase, Coursera,
  Philanthropy University, and now Anthropic — has been about building communities that serve
  diverse populations. He evaluates whether a project widens access or narrows it, whether it
  serves the many or the few. (Source: career trajectory across LinkedIn)

- **Internationalization as default**: With 11+ languages and 10+ countries of residence, Jason
  does not view internationalization as a feature — it is a baseline expectation. He notices when
  a project is English-only, when UI text is hardcoded, when date formats assume US conventions.

- **Clear storytelling and narrative**: As a community professional, Jason evaluates narrative
  quality — can you explain what this does and why it matters to someone who is not a developer?
  His Reddit experience involved making complex platform dynamics understandable to diverse
  audiences. (Source: career at Reddit community leadership)

- **Democratizing access to technology**: His Coursera and Philanthropy University work was
  explicitly about removing barriers to education and empowering underserved populations. He
  brings this lens to developer tools — is this accessible to people who are not already experts?
  (Source: Gray Area profile; Coursera/Philanthropy University background)

- **Output over process**: "Relentlessly output focused, producing work and insights that could
  reasonably be expected from a small team." This characterization from a colleague suggests
  Jason values results over methodology. What did you build? Does it work? What impact does
  it have? (Source: LinkedIn recommendation, cited in compass artifact)

- **Community-first product thinking**: Jason evaluates products through the lens of community
  adoption — will people share this? Will they recommend it? Does it create network effects?
  His Reddit and Meta experience is in platforms where community dynamics determine success.
  (Source: career trajectory)

- **Global perspective**: Jason's international background means he evaluates from a global
  perspective by default. He has built communities across continents and cultures. A project
  that only works for San Francisco developers misses his evaluation lens.

## What They Value (Evaluation Criteria)

Based on Jason's career and public activities, the following would score highest:

- **Clear, compelling narrative**: Can you explain what this does in one sentence to a non-developer?
  Is the pitch clear? Is the story memorable? Jason has spent his career communicating complex
  platform dynamics to diverse audiences — he evaluates communication quality rigorously.

- **Community impact**: Who does this help? How many people? Is the user base limited to expert
  developers or accessible to a broader audience? Jason's career is about broadening access, not
  serving the already-served.

- **Accessibility to non-technical users**: Can someone who is not a developer understand the value?
  Can they use it (or at least understand the demo)? Jason represents the non-engineering
  perspective on the panel. He will evaluate whether the project communicates beyond its
  technical audience.

- **Internationalization readiness**: Are strings hardcoded or extracted? Is the UI right-to-left
  (RTL) aware? Does it support non-Latin scripts? Are date/number formats locale-aware? With
  11+ languages, Jason will notice internationalization gaps.

- **Demo and presentation quality**: The demo video, the submission narrative, the visual
  presentation of the project — Jason evaluates these as a community professional evaluates
  content. Is it clear? Is it engaging? Would it work as a conference talk?

- **Practical utility**: Does this solve a real problem for real people? Is it a tool that people
  would actually use, or is it a technical exercise? Jason's "output focused" nature means he
  values practical results.

- **Potential for community adoption**: Could this project build a community around it? Are there
  network effects? Can users customize it, share their configurations, contribute panels?
  Jason's entire career is about community growth dynamics.

- **Inclusive design**: Does the project consider diverse users — different skill levels, different
  languages, different abilities? Does the design welcome newcomers? Jason's community work
  always centers on inclusion.

## Red Flags

Jason would penalize projects that exhibit these characteristics:

- **No clear narrative**: If you cannot explain what the project does and why it matters in plain
  language, it fails Jason's most basic test. Technical jargon without translation to impact
  is a communication failure.

- **Only for experts**: Projects that require deep technical knowledge to understand, install,
  or appreciate. Jason represents the broadest audience on the panel — if it is only impressive
  to AI engineers, it misses his evaluation criteria.

- **No consideration of diverse users**: English-only with no internationalization thought.
  Inaccessible to people with disabilities. Assumes a specific technical environment. Does not
  consider global users.

- **Poor presentation and demo**: Unclear video, confusing walkthrough, missing context. As a
  community professional, Jason evaluates presentation as a core skill — not a nice-to-have.

- **No community potential**: A closed, single-use tool with no extensibility, no sharing
  mechanism, no way for others to build on it. Jason evaluates whether a project can grow
  beyond its creator.

- **All technical, no human story**: Projects that focus entirely on technical achievement
  without connecting to human impact. Jason wants to know: who benefits and how does this
  make their life better?

## How BoardClaude Impresses Them

BoardClaude addresses Jason's evaluation criteria through specific design decisions:

- **Clear, memorable narrative**: "Assemble a board of AI agents that evaluate your project from
  multiple expert perspectives." One sentence. Understandable by non-developers. The metaphor
  of a "board of directors" for your code is immediately intuitive — everyone understands what
  a board meeting is, even if they do not write code.

- **Democratizing expert review**: BoardClaude makes multi-perspective evaluation accessible to
  solo developers who cannot afford a team of expert reviewers. A student, a freelancer, or a
  first-time open source contributor can get feedback that previously required a team. This is
  the democratization narrative Jason's career is built on.

- **Community-extensible design**: The panel YAML system means anyone can create and share custom
  evaluation panels. Users can build YC-partner panels, code-review panels for their specific
  team, startup-pitch panels, or personal accountability boards. This creates natural community
  dynamics — sharing configurations, comparing approaches, building on each other's work.

- **International accessibility**: The dashboard uses clean, translatable UI text. Agent
  personas are documented in structured format that could be adapted for non-English
  evaluators. The evaluation framework itself is language-agnostic — panel YAMLs can be
  configured for any evaluation context in any language.

- **Compelling demo**: The self-evaluation story (score climbing from 44 to 90) is a narrative
  arc that anyone can understand — including non-developers. The proof layer (evaluating an
  external project and comparing predicted vs. actual scores) adds credibility. The personal
  closed-loop fix pipeline is a relatable concept for anyone who struggles with scope
  creep.

- **Multiple audience levels**: The dashboard serves technical users (detailed scores, code
  references, action items) while the radar chart and narrative summaries serve non-technical
  stakeholders. BoardClaude can be understood at multiple levels of technical depth.

- **Practical, real-world utility**: BoardClaude solves a genuine problem — the anxiety of not
  knowing how evaluators will respond to your work before submission. This applies to hackathons,
  job applications, grant proposals, startup pitches, and code reviews. The breadth of
  application demonstrates the kind of broad impact Jason values.
