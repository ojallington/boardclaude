## Composite Score

| Score | Grade | Verdict | Delta |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|
| **83.45** | B | PASS | -0.06 from iter-9 (83.51) |

## Radar

| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Architecture (Boris) | 86.0 |
| Product (Cat) | 86.65 |
| Innovation (Thariq) | 74.3 |
| Code Quality (Lydia) | 87.75 |
| Documentation (Ado) | 89.0 |
| Integration (Jason) | 76.25 |

## Per-Agent Breakdown

| Agent | Model | Composite | Verdict |
|-------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Boris | opus | 86.0 | STRONG_PASS |
| Cat | opus | 86.65 | STRONG_PASS |
| Thariq | opus | 74.3 | PASS |
| Lydia | opus | 87.75 | STRONG_PASS |
| Ado | sonnet | 89.0 | STRONG_PASS |
| Jason | sonnet | 76.25 | PASS |

## Top Strengths (Multi-Agent Consensus)

1. **Route decomposition completed:** 574 to 184 lines with clean orchestrator pipeline in try-invoke.ts, try-debate.ts, try-synthesize.ts (Boris, Cat, Thariq agree)
2. **Validation system comprehensive:** 8 validators, 52 dedicated tests, 3-layer verification boundary wired at every data exchange point (Boris, Lydia, Jason agree)
3. **TypeScript exemplary:** strict mode + noUncheckedIndexedAccess, zero `any` types, tuple types, `as const satisfies`, discriminated unions (Boris, Lydia agree)
4. **Try-It-Now zero-install flow** delivers aha moment in under 60 seconds with BYOK progressive disclosure and cost estimates (Cat primary, Jason confirms)
5. **Outstanding accessibility:** skip-to-content, ARIA progressbars, useReducedMotion, focus-visible, keyboard nav (Ado, Jason agree)

## Top Weaknesses

1. **Type assertions bypass validation:** try-synthesize.ts has 5 `as` casts, usePanelStream has 7 bare assertions on SSE data (Boris, Lydia consensus)
2. **Serial file fetching unresolved from iter-9:** github.ts makes 40 sequential HTTP roundtrips for BYOK tier (Boris, Thariq -- 2 iterations flagged)
3. **Only 1 of 6 agents has tool_use:** 83% are single-turn text generators (Thariq, Boris agree)
4. **No share button** on web review results (Cat)
5. **Debate mechanism decorative:** 1 round, no score adjustments, doesn't influence synthesis (Thariq)

## Divergent Opinions

### AI system maturity vs code quality (delta: 13.45)
Thariq scores 74.3 seeing fundamental AI limitations (single-turn agents, thin debate, no emergent behavior); Lydia scores 87.75 seeing exemplary TypeScript patterns and React architecture. Both correct -- pristine codebase, underutilized AI capabilities.

### Documentation completeness (delta: 12.75)
Ado scores 89.0 seeing comprehensive README, a11y docs, community infrastructure; Jason scores 76.25 flagging i18n=48 and missing npm package. Ado evaluates what exists (excellent), Jason evaluates what's missing (global readiness gaps).

## Top 10 Action Items

| P | Action | Effort | Source | Files |
|---|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Add validation in buildSynthesizedResult -- replace 5 type assertions with validated field access | medium | boris, lydia | try-synthesize.ts |
| 2 | Parallelize file fetching in github.ts with Promise.all + concurrency limiter | medium | boris, thariq | github.ts |
| 3 | Add type narrowing guards for SSE event data in usePanelStream.ts | low | boris, lydia | usePanelStream.ts |
| 4 | Enable tool_use for Thariq and Lydia agents | low | thariq | try-agents.ts |
| 5 | Add share button to web review results page | low | cat | results/web/[auditId]/page.tsx |
| 6 | Surface specific error codes from route.ts in usePanelStream | medium | jason | usePanelStream.ts |
| 7 | Migrate results/web/[auditId]/page.tsx to EvaluationList | low | lydia | results/web/[auditId]/page.tsx |
| 8 | Make debate influence synthesis scoring | medium | thariq | try-debate.ts, try-agents.ts |
| 9 | Create COMMANDS.md command reference | low | ado | COMMANDS.md |
| 10 | Simplify README install to one path | low | ado | README.md |
