# Audit Report: BoardClaude — Iteration 7

**Panel:** hackathon-judges | **Date:** 2026-02-11T17:45:11Z | **Target:** boardclaude

## Composite Score

| Score | Grade | Verdict | Delta |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|
| **83.87** | **B** | **PASS** | **-6.93** from iter-6 (90.80) |

> **Note:** Regression driven primarily by Thariq's stricter evaluation of AI innovation (68.9 vs ~89 in iter-6). The codebase improved but evaluation criteria tightened — Thariq now penalizes heavily for static thinking budgets, absent debate rounds, and missing cross-iteration memory in the web pipeline.

## Per-Agent Scores

| Agent | Composite | Verdict | Key Dimension |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Boris | 90.0 | STRONG_PASS | Architecture=91, Verification=88 |
| Cat | 85.7 | STRONG_PASS | Narrative=91, User Value=88 |
| Thariq | 68.9 | PASS | AI Innovation=78, Emergent=52 |
| Lydia | 89.45 | STRONG_PASS | Code Quality=91, DX=90 |
| Ado | 93.0 | STRONG_PASS | Accessibility=96, Documentation=92 |
| Jason | 75.8 | PASS | Integration=92, i18n=42 |

## Top Strengths (2+ agents agree)

1. **Runtime validation pipeline** (Boris, Lydia): validate.ts (753 lines) covers every external data boundary with typed validators and field-level error messages. try-storage.ts uses validateTryPanelResult() instead of raw JSON.parse casting.

2. **Accessibility exceeds WCAG 2.1 AA** (Ado, Lydia): skip-to-content link, useReducedMotion in all animated components, 37+ ARIA attributes, focus-visible on 35+ interactive elements across 19 files.

3. **Zero-friction Try-It-Now with persistent shareable results** (Cat, Ado, Boris): Paste URL, get 6-agent streaming results, share the link. Upstash Redis persistence with 30-day TTL enables viral distribution.

---

## Top Weaknesses (2+ agents agree)

1. **No cross-iteration memory in web pipeline** (Thariq, Cat): Each review is stateless — no reference to previous reviews of the same repo. The CLI supports cross-iteration context but the web product doesn't.

2. **Static thinking budgets** (Thariq): budget_tokens:10000 for all Opus agents, ignoring the panel YAML's effort levels (max/high/medium). Checking a box, not leveraging the capability.

3. **Internationalization near-zero** (Jason): English-only, hardcoded 'en-US' locales, no RTL support, no i18n framework despite centralized messages.ts.

## Divergent Opinions

### Thariq (68.9) vs Ado (93.0) — 24.1 point gap
- **Thariq:** "Additive intelligence, not emergent" — static thinking budgets, no debate, no cross-iteration memory
- **Ado:** "Documentation and accessibility at a level where a developer would trust this project within 5 minutes"
- **Analysis:** Both correct. The project excels at polish and DX but underutilizes Opus 4.6's frontier capabilities.

### Boris (90.0) vs Jason (75.8) — 14.2 point gap
- **Boris:** Clean architecture, comprehensive validation, sound parallel execution
- **Jason:** English-only with hardcoded locales is a structural blocker for global reach (i18n=42)
- **Analysis:** Architecture is strong but i18n investment is near-zero. Less critical for hackathon demo but valid for real-world adoption.
