## Agent Scores

### Boris (Architecture & Verification) -- Weight: 0.20
| Criterion | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Architecture | 92 |
| Verification | 93 |
| Compound Learning | 90 |
| Simplicity | 85 |
| **Composite** | **91.2** |
| **Verdict** | **STRONG_PASS** |

**Strengths:**
- All 3 iter-14 action items resolved in a single fix cycle: DRY violation, SSESender extraction, 70 new tests
- 244 tests across 18 files -- most comprehensive test suite yet
- Pipeline architecture is clean: route.ts orchestrates linear flow through try-invoke -> try-debate -> try-revisions -> try-synthesize

**Weaknesses:**
- try-storage.ts (254 lines) remains untested
- JSON.parse casts still use `as Record<string, unknown>` instead of parseToRecord helper
- Board builder uses type assertions in reducer

| Criterion | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| User Value | 94 |
| Adoption Path | 93 |
| Narrative | 92 |
| Market Fit | 84 |
| **Composite** | **91.35** |
| **Verdict** | **STRONG_PASS** |

**Strengths:**
- All 3 iter-14 product blockers resolved: npx install, YAML preview, Install nav link
- User journey from discovery to first value is now genuinely excellent
- Board Builder with real-time YAML preview resolves 5+ iteration chronic issue

**Weaknesses:**
- Score progression on landing page uses static data instead of real state.json history
- No clear path from Try It Now results to "fix and re-evaluate"
- YAML preview collapsed by default -- may go undiscovered

| Emergent Behavior | 78 |
| Efficiency | 89 |
| **Composite** | **83.95** |
| **Verdict** | **PASS** |

**Strengths:**
- Prompt caching enabled (cache_control: ephemeral), reducing costs 40-50%
- Full debate exchange text propagated through cross-iteration context
- BYOK file budget doubled from 400K to 800K chars

**Weaknesses:**
- CHRONIC: No Claude Agent SDK Agent Teams for parallel coordination
- 800K chars uses only ~20% of 1M context window
- No adaptive effort calibration based on repo complexity

| **Verdict** | **STRONG_PASS** |

**Strengths:**
- Suspense boundaries and DRY fix properly implemented
- Test coverage jumped +70 to 244 tests across 18 files
- Board Builder demonstrates excellent pattern usage (useReducer, useMemo, useCallback)

**Weaknesses:**
- JSON.parse casts still present in try-invoke.ts and try-synthesize.ts
- Board builder reducer uses type assertions
- 28 text-gray-400 instances remain across 14 files

| **Verdict** | **STRONG_PASS** |

**Strengths:**
- aria-live on /try page makes evaluation flow accessible to screen reader users
- Text contrast fixes reduced text-gray-400 from 41 to 28
- Install command updated to correct npx path, community infrastructure complete

**Weaknesses:**
- No runnable demo project in examples/ (deferred, high effort)
- README lacks score progression screenshot/GIF
- Remaining text-gray-400 in body text contexts
