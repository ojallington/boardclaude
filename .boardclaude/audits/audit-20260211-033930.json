Jason's position is stronger from a global community impact perspective — the project's mission (democratizing AI evaluation) directly benefits from multilingual support. However, Lydia correctly identifies that premature i18n infrastructure adds maintenance burden. The resolution should be incremental: restore basic i18n scaffolding (Accept-Language detection, translation file structure) but defer full translation until there's concrete demand. Jason's 72 score reflects real community limitation; Lydia's 91 reflects good immediate engineering judgment."

Thariq tracks strategic innovation items from his iter-5 recommendations (debate rounds, cross-iteration context) — these were deferred. This divergence reveals prioritization choice: the team focused on production readiness (Boris's domain) over advanced AI capabilities (Thariq's domain). Given proximity to launch, Boris's assessment is more relevant to current milestone. Thariq's concerns are valid for post-launch roadmap. No conflict — different evaluation timeframes."
